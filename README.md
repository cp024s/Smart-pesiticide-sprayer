## MAIN MODULE:
Movement: This module controls the movement of the device, likely a rover or sprayer.
Pan and Tilt: Two servos are used for adjusting the orientation (pan and tilt) of the sprayer and possibly the camera.
DC Pump: The DC pump is used for water pumping, likely for irrigation or spraying.
Remote Control: This module seems to have a communication interface, possibly via Wi-Fi, to receive commands and transmit data to and from a central server or control interface.

## SUB MODULE (SENSOR MODULE):
Sensor Integration: This module integrates various sensors such as temperature and humidity sensors, soil moisture sensors, and an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection.
Data Collection: These sensors collect data related to environmental conditions and obstacles in real-time.
Communication: Like the main module, this sub-module communicates data wirelessly, likely to the central server or controller.

## CAM MODULE:
Live Footage: This module captures and streams live footage, possibly from a camera attached to the rover.
Video Transmission: It's responsible for transmitting the live video feed to a central server or monitoring station.
Remote Viewing: Users can remotely view the live video feed to monitor the operation of the device.
