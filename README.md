## Features

- Precise and automated pesticide spraying.
- Integration with environmental sensors for optimal spraying conditions.
- Real-time data monitoring and control through a mobile app.
- Efficient use of pesticides, reducing environmental impact.
- Customizable settings for different crops and conditions.

## Components

To replicate this project, you'll need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Motorized sprayer mechanism
- Environmental sensors (e.g., humidity, temperature)
- GPS module (optional)
- Relay module for pump control
- Mobile app for remote monitoring and control
- Power source (e.g., battery or solar panel)
- Enclosure for protection against weather

## Installation

1. **Arduino IDE**: Install the Arduino IDE on your computer if you haven't already.

2. **Libraries**: Install any required libraries by going to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries" in the Arduino IDE.

3. **Hardware Assembly**: Assemble the hardware components following the project's wiring diagrams and instructions. Ensure that all connections are secure and functional.

4. **Software Configuration**: Upload the Arduino sketch (`smart_pesticide_sprayer.ino`) to your Arduino board. Customize the configuration variables in the code to match your specific setup and requirements.

5. **Mobile App Setup**: If your project includes a mobile app for remote control, follow the app's installation and setup instructions. Ensure it can communicate with the Arduino board.

## Usage

1. **Power On**: Turn on the Smart Pesticide Sprayer and ensure it is connected to the mobile app if applicable.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**: The system will continuously monitor environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, etc.) and crop data.

3. **Automated Spraying**: Based on the collected data and predefined settings, the sprayer will automatically activate when optimal conditions are met.

4. **Manual Control**: You can also control the sprayer manually through the mobile app or physical controls if provided.

5. **Data Logging**: The system may log environmental and spraying data for later analysis.

## MAIN MODULE:
***Movement:*** This module controls the movement of the device, likely a rover or sprayer.

***Pan and Tilt:*** Two servos are used for adjusting the orientation (pan and tilt) of the sprayer and possibly the camera.

***DC Pump:*** The DC pump is used for water pumping, likely for irrigation or spraying.

***Remote Control:*** This module seems to have a communication interface, possibly via Wi-Fi, to receive commands and transmit data to and from a central server or control interface.

## SUB MODULE (SENSOR MODULE):
***Sensor Integration:*** This module integrates various sensors such as temperature and humidity sensors, soil moisture sensors, and an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection.

***Data Collection:*** These sensors collect data related to environmental conditions and obstacles in real-time.

***Communication:*** Like the main module, this sub-module communicates data wirelessly, likely to the central server or controller.

## CAM MODULE:
***Live Footage:*** This module captures and streams live footage, possibly from a camera attached to the rover.

***Video Transmission:*** It's responsible for transmitting the live video feed to a central server or monitoring station.

***Remote Viewing:*** Users can remotely view the live video feed to monitor the operation of the device.
